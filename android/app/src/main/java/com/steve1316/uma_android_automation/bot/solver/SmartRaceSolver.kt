/**
 * Public entry point for the Smart Race Solver.
 *
 * The solver is a pure function: given a [SolverState] it produces a [Schedule]. The wiring
 * layer in Racing.kt is responsible for constructing the state from settings and feeding the
 * resulting schedule to the existing race-execution path.
 *
 * Two backends are available:
 *  - [MilpSolver] (default) - exact MILP via ojAlgo. Mirrors the reference Trackblazer
 *    site's GLPK formulation and produces optimal schedules.
 *  - [Heuristic] - original beam-search, retained as a fallback when MILP is infeasible
 *    (e.g., contradictory forced epithets) or for benchmarking.
 *
 * Re-solving on race loss is handled by callers: build a fresh [SolverState] with the lost
 * epithet added to [SolverState.deadEpithets] and call [solve] again.
